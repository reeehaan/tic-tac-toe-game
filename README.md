## 🧠 How the Game Works

- Each player takes turns marking a cell in the 3×3 grid.  
- The app checks all possible **winning combinations** (rows, columns, diagonals).  
- If a player has three of their marks in a line — 🎉 they win!  
- If all cells are filled with no winner → it's a **draw**.  
- Players can rename themselves and restart anytime.
